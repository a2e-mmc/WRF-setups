#                  HOW TO RUN WRF WITH setUp_WRF.sh                  #
######################################################################
This executable will set up a WRF run from downloading the necessary
Reanalysis data, to copying or linking over any executables and 
required WRF files, and generating an Eagle submission script.

To use:
1. Set up your namelist.wps file to generate the correct domain size,
   grid spacing, location, map projection, simulation time, etc.
   --- You can use "ncl plotgrids_old.ncl" to plot the domains from
       the namelist.wps file to make sure it looks like what you want.
   --- Once this is done, make the changes to the
       namelist.wps.template file so that it will be included in the
       executable script. YOU MUST MAKE THE CHANGES TO THE TEMPLATE
       FILE IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE USED IN THE SIMULATION!
   
2. Set up your namelist.input.template to use the right grid numbers,
   grid spacing, parent_ij_start, and other variables from the WPS 
   step (above).
   Also, make any changes to the parameterization schemes (if desired).

3. Open the setUp_WRF.sh and change the user variables in the header
   specifying the start date, number of hours to simulate, which
   Reanalysis dataset to use, number of domains, etc.
   --- Currently, the ERA-Interim and GFS datasets can be downloaded 
       automatically. For ERA-5 and NARR, you will need to download 
       the data manually.
       + NARR: https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds608.0/#!access
       --- you will need an RDA account.
       + ERA-5: follow directions here:
         https://wiki.nrelcloud.org/wiki/index.php/TheWiki/WRF#Downloading_data_and_running_WRF_with_ERA5
   --- Make sure the HOME_DIR, WPS_DIR, ICBC_DIR, EXE_DIR, and OUT_DIR
       are set correctly. See comments in code for descriptions of
       each path.

4. Run setUp_WRF.sh
   --- This will only run the WRF Pre-processing System (WPS) steps
       and setup the simulations to run, but not run the simulations
   --- To run the simulations, simply execute:
       "sbatch submit_real.sh" to run real.exe
       "sbatch submit_wrf.sh" to run wrf.exe
